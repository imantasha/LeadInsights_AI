# LeadSight AI - Approach Report

## Problem Statement
Sales teams often lack enriched, actionable data to evaluate B2B leads. Manual research is time-consuming, and irrelevant leads waste time and money.

## Our Solution
LeadSight AI streamlines the lead enrichment process using free tools (WHOIS + Google search) to extract high-impact data:
- LinkedIn presence (for professional verification)
- Domain age (for trust factor)
- Website match (to reduce spam or mismatches)

## Data Preprocessing
- Deduplication of records
- Validity checks on URLs and domains
- Google Search used to extract best-guess LinkedIn URLs
- WHOIS lookup done using `whois` package

## Scoring Logic
- +10 points: LinkedIn found
- +5 points: Domain matches company name
- +5 points: Recent domain registration (<5 yrs)

## Output
- Score assigned to each lead
- UI allows filtering by high score
- CSV downloadable with all enriched insights

## Model Used
No ML model used. Rule-based scoring logic + enrichment scripts.
